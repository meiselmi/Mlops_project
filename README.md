# MLOps End-to-End Pipeline: Automating Machine Learning Deployment

This project showcases a robust **MLOps** workflow by implementing an **end-to-end machine learning pipeline** designed for real-world applications. It leverages modern tools and frameworks to automate the machine learning lifecycle‚Äîencompassing data ingestion, model training, evaluation, and deployment‚Äîensuring scalability and reproducibility.

---

## üöÄ Key Features:

- **Data Pipeline:**  
  - Seamlessly ingests, preprocesses, and cleans data from a customer dataset.
  - Automatically splits the data into training and testing sets, ready for model training.

- **Model Training:**  
  - Utilizes machine learning algorithms to train on the processed dataset.
  - Evaluates the model‚Äôs performance using key metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R¬≤** score.

- **Automated Deployment Decision:**  
  - Implements a **deployment trigger** step based on model accuracy.
  - Only models meeting the accuracy threshold are selected for deployment.

- **Model Deployment:**  
  - Deploys the model using **MLflow** for version tracking and monitoring.
  - Utilizes **ZenML** to orchestrate the pipeline and integrate multiple steps.
  - Runs the deployment pipeline inside **Docker** containers, ensuring **reproducibility** and **scalability**.

## üõ† Tools and Frameworks Used:

- **ZenML:**  
  A powerful MLOps framework to manage, track, and orchestrate machine learning pipelines.

- **MLflow:**  
  An open-source platform for managing the complete machine learning lifecycle, including experimentation, model tracking, and deployment.

- **Docker:**  
  For creating lightweight, portable containers that ensure reproducibility and scalability across environments.

- **Python:**  
  The core language used to implement the entire pipeline, leveraging popular machine learning libraries like **scikit-learn**, **pandas**, and more.

## üîç Detailed Workflow:

1. **Ingest Data:**  
   The pipeline starts by reading and cleaning the customer data. It handles missing values, outliers, and other common data preprocessing tasks to prepare it for modeling.

2. **Train Model:**  
   The cleaned data is used to train a machine learning model. Performance is evaluated using regression metrics (MSE and R¬≤).

3. **Evaluate and Decide Deployment:**  
   The deployment decision is made automatically based on model performance. If the model meets the accuracy threshold, it triggers the deployment step.

4. **Deploy Model:**  
   The trained model is deployed in a controlled Docker environment, and its performance is tracked using MLflow.
