This project demonstrates a complete MLOps workflow by implementing an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for a real-world use case. The workflow integrates modern MLOps tools and frameworks to streamline the model lifecycle, from data ingestion to model deployment.

Key Features:
Data Pipeline:

Reads and preprocesses data from a customer dataset.
Cleans and splits the data into training and testing sets.
Model Training:

Trains a machine learning model on the processed data.
Evaluates model performance using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and RÂ².
Deployment Decision:

Implements a deployment trigger step to automate decisions based on model accuracy.
Ensures models meeting predefined thresholds are deployed.
Model Deployment:

Uses MLflow and ZenML to deploy the model.
Configures the deployment pipeline to run in Docker containers for reproducibility.
Tools and Frameworks:
ZenML: For managing and orchestrating the ML pipeline.
MLflow: For model tracking and deployment.
Docker: For creating portable, reproducible environments.
Python: For implementing the entire pipeline.
Outcome:
The project automates the process of training, evaluating, and deploying machine learning models, making it scalable and efficient for real-world applications.
